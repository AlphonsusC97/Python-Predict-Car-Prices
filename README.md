Python Machine Learning Model Development: Created a regression predictor to correctly predict used car 
prices based on ~80 features.

> Data Preprocessing: Applied dummy encoding for categorical variables and ordinal encoding for features 
with large value range. Cleaned, transformed and imputed missing data to prepare for model training.

> Feature Engineering: Created new features based on existing ones to improve model accuracy.

> Modelling and Tuning: Implemented multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost
and LightGBM. Conducted hyperparameter tuning using RandomisedSearchCV. Developed 
StackingRegressor that combined predictions from multiple base models to enhance predictive performance.

> Evaluation: Measured model performance using RMSE, R-squared, precision, recall, and F1-score.

> Deployment: Used Pickle module to save the best models for future use.

> Visualization: Utilized Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

> Data Manipulation: Proficiently handled and transformed data using Pandas and NumPy.
